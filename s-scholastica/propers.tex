    Brethren: "He

    approved who commends himself, but he whom the
    Lord commends. Would to God that you could bear
    with a little of my foolishness! Nay, do bear with me!
    For I am jealous for you with a divine jealousy. For I
    betrothed you to one spouse, that I might present you
    a chaste virgin to Christ.
